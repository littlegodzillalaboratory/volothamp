# Chapter 2: The Road of Broken Signs

The road west of Oakhurst was narrow and quiet, winding through low hills and patches of frost-covered grass. The ruined village slowly disappeared behind the companions as they walked, but none of them felt ready to forget it.

Selene led the way, her steps light and careful. Ashwing circled above, sometimes crying out softly.
“They passed through here,” she said, kneeling near the ground. “Heavy boots. Wagons. And they weren’t trying to hide.”

“Confident,” Bramble said. “That usually means trouble.”

Kaelen adjusted the strap of his shield. “Or they don’t expect anyone to follow.”

“Then they’ve made a mistake,” Durik replied firmly.

By midday, the land changed. Tall trees rose ahead—the edge of the High Forest. The air felt cooler there, thicker somehow, as if the woods were listening.

Thorn slowed his pace. “Magic lingers here,” he said quietly. “Not dangerous… but watchful.”

Bramble glanced at him. “That’s comforting. I think.”

As they entered the forest, they found the first clear sign of the Circle of Thorns: a broken wooden marker nailed to a tree. A black symbol—twisted vines around a dead tree—had been carved into it.

Kaelen clenched his jaw. “They want people to see this.”

“Fear travels faster than fire,” Durik said.

Not long after, Ashwing cried out sharply.

Selene raised her hand. Everyone stopped.

Ahead, the path narrowed between fallen logs. Shapes moved in the shadows.

“Ambush?” Bramble whispered.

“Not a very good one,” Thorn said, sparks dancing between his fingers.

Three figures stepped out—rough-looking men in dark cloaks, each holding a spear. Their faces were tense, not cruel.

“Drop your weapons!” one shouted. “This road is claimed!”

Kaelen stepped forward, lowering his sword—but not dropping it.
“We’re not here to fight you. Leave this road.”

The men hesitated. One looked back nervously.
“We don’t want trouble,” he said. “But the Circle—”

“You don’t owe them anything,” Durik said, his voice calm but strong. “Walk away.”

For a moment, no one moved.

Then one of the men lowered his spear. Another followed. The third swallowed hard and ran.

The remaining two fled into the trees.

Bramble blinked. “Well… that went better than expected.”

Kaelen nodded. “Not everyone who serves evil chooses it freely.”

They camped that night beneath a ring of tall pines. Selene set simple traps. Bramble checked them twice—just in case. Durik shared warm bread from his pack, and Thorn carefully warmed the fire with magic no stronger than a candle flame.

As the stars appeared, Bramble spoke up.
“Why do we keep doing this?”

Kaelen looked at her. “Because someone has to.”

Durik smiled. “Because if we don’t stand up, evil spreads.”

Thorn stared into the fire. “Because we’re stronger together.”

Selene nodded. “Tomorrow, we reach the river. After that… we catch them.”

The fire crackled softly as the companions settled in for the night.

Ahead lay the River Dessarin, the ruined watchtower Selene had seen in her dreams—and the heart of the Circle of Thorns’ trail.

And the Ashen Fellowship would not turn back.
